		<h3>About the Project</h3>
		<p>
		ADBWUI is built from the ground up for use on virtually any computer that can run NodeJS + adb.
		Based on the ADBGUI project & idea, ADBWUI is here to help even the most novice of users.<br />
		ADBWUI uses only open source and/or free projects, and can be modified to fit your needs including becoming a kiosk for Phone Repair shops, stores, etc. <br />
		The idea of using NodeJS is simple: It is cross-platform for Windows, Linux, & Mac OSX. This makes it extremely simple to run adb (given that it is installed first) on any computer without the need for using complicated command line options (Or if you're just lazy like me ;) )
